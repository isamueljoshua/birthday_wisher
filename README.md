# BIRTHDAY WISHER
This is a program written on 23-11-2019 to wish anyone you want pythonically :)
I did this since it's my birthday today.

## How to run this code?
Just clone this repo and cd into it and in your command prompt or terminal, first run `pip install pillow` then run the command `python birthday_wish.py`.

This will ask for input 
```
Please enter your name: John
Happy birthday to?: Jack Doe
```
And produces output
```
    *****************************************     
        !!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY Jack Doe  !!!
    *****************************************

```
(with a few decorative stars around it)

Even if you don't give a name it just prints 
```
    *****************************************     
        !!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRIEND!!  !!!
    *****************************************

```

## Output Generate png image
Currently the program writes the from and to names into the template file and saves the png into this same folder, here's an example output.

![Output image](Jack_Doe.png "Jack Doe output")

Note: This is a downloded template, all design ideas and designs belong to the designer, my python code has just written the names Jack Doe and Jack on top of it

Enjoy !!!

## Future of this Project
### Phase 1
I am planning to add more templates, so that the user will have more options to choose from.
### Phase 2
I am considering creating a UI with this idea in mind, so that it would be useful for a much bigger community
