## BIRTHDAY WISHER
This is a program written on today 23-11-2019 to wish anyone you want pythonically :)
I did this since it's my birthday today and just for fun

# How to run this code?
Just clone this repo and cd into it and run the command like 'python birthday_wish.py Jack Doe'
This will produce the output HAPPY BIRTHDAY Jack Doe  
(with a few decorative stars around it)

Even if you don't give a name it just prints HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

Enjoy !!!
